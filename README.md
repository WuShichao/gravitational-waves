# gravitational-waves
Workshop notebooks explaining how matched filtering and MCMC techniques are used to detect gravitational waves. Static versions also available, see [part 1](https://marcotompitak.github.io/matched-filter/) and [part2](https://marcotompitak.github.io/pe-pymc/)

 - Part 1 Matched Filtering: Explaining how matched filtering can be used to dig up signals buried in overwhelming noise.
 - Part 2 Parameter Estimation with `pymc`: How to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques, provided by the `pymc` package, to do matched-filter parameter estimation.
